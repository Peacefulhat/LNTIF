Learning New Things Is Fun

Learning something new is exciting! Whether it's anything, the process of figuring things out and the feeling you get after solving a problem you were stuck on—that joy is unmatched.

This project is an experimental project aimed at motivating others to continuously learn, even if the things they learn are small or don’t contribute to others' lives. But that’s not the point—learning is fun, and you never know when that knowledge might come in handy (I’ve been in situations where I was so glad I knew these things).
